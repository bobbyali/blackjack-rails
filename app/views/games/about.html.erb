	<p class="tagline">The super-speedy Blackjack game! Will you be quick enough on the draw?</p>

	<p>
    <a href="/">speedJack</a> was built by Rehan Ali, a.k.a. Daddy, a.k.a. “stink bug”, for a Ruby on Rails project during <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/">The Firehose Project</a>. It’s a Blackjack game with a difference - you only have 1 second to decide to hold, otherwise the computer will automatically hit (draw another card) for you.
